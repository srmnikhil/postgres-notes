# PostgreSQL Notes

This repository contains my personal learning notes and experiments while studying **PostgreSQL**.

The goal of this repo is to build a strong foundation in relational databases by documenting:
- Core SQL concepts
- Practical query examples
- Database design patterns
- Performance and indexing basics

## Structure

The repository is organized by topics:

postgres-notes/
  basics/         → installation, datatypes, constraints  
  <!-- queries/        → joins, subqueries, window functions  
  indexing/       → btree, gin, gist  
  transactions/   → isolation levels, locks, deadlocks  
  projects/       → small real-world schemas   -->

## How to use

- `.md` files contain explanations and theory.
- `.sql` files contain executable queries tested on PostgreSQL.

Each topic usually has both:
- A markdown file for concepts
- A SQL file for hands-on examples

## Purpose

This repo is meant to be:
- A daily learning log
- A personal reference for future projects and future remembering
- A practical study resource for backend development
